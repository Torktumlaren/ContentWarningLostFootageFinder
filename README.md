# ContentWarningLostFootageFinder
Finds and extracts lost footage you didn't manage to save during a dive or session.

## Install
* Download and extract, or clone this repository.
* Open a terminal in the project directory.
* run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Simply type `python ContentWarningLostFootageFinder.py` into a terminal aimed at the project directory, and the program will try to extract any lost footage.

Keep in mind, Content Warning wipes all previous temporary recordings upon startup, so this only works until you start the game again.

Also, if you are currently in a session, just press `F3` and the game will extract lost footage for you.
